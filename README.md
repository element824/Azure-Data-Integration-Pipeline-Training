# __Microsoft Data Integration Pipeline Training
## The Fundamentals to Level 300
### _with Paul Andrew_

![Slide Header](./Images/ReadMe%20Header.png)

Hey friends and welcome to my training workshop on __Microsoft Data Integration Pipelines__. 

## Overview

In this full day of training, we’ll start with the very basics and learn how to orchestrate your Azure data platform from start to finish. You will learn how to build out Azure control flow and data flow components as processing pipelines using Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics. We’ll start by covering the fundamentals within the resources and together build out pipelines that ingest data from local source systems, transform and serve it to consumers. We’ll then continue taking an end-to-end look at our Azure integration pipeline tools within highly scalable cloud native architectures, dealing with triggering, monitoring, dynamic pipeline content as well as CI/CD practices. Start the day knowing nothing about Azure Data Integration pipelines and leave with the knowledge, slides, demos, and code to apply these resources in your role as a data engineering professional.

## Suggested Prerequisites

If participating in any of these training workshop there will be labs to work through and demo code to optionally participate in. These labs will focus on the development of Azure data platform resources, it is therefore recommended that you bring the following ready to use. There will be little spare time for initial setup work.

* Most importantly, access to a Microsoft Azure Tenant including a usable Azure Subscription.
  * A free trial account is sufficient, but please have this setup prior to the event to avoid delays.
  * This should include the ability to provision resources in an Azure Resource Group with owner level access.
* A developer laptop with power and some form of WiFi connectivity (sorry if obvious).
* Suggested software to be installed on your laptop to make the learning experience run smoothly:
  * A modern web browser, Microsoft Edge or similar as preferred.
  * A suitable IDE, VSCode or Visual Studio including Azure development extensions.
  * Database tools, SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Data Studio.
  * GitHub desktop or similar for repository interaction.
  * Azure Storage Explorer.
  * A PDF file viewer.
* Play the Azure Icon Game, it will help. See blog post for context: [https://mrpaulandrew.com/2017/12/15/the-azure-icon-game](https://mrpaulandrew.com/2017/12/15/the-azure-icon-game)

For software downloads, please complete these tasks prior to the event to avoid internet bandwidth contention for other attendees.

_Many thanks_
